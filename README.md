# AI to the edge
## The handwriting recognition tutorial 
This project is an hand on guide to deploy an artificial neural network to a low power MCU, in particular the target is to recognize digits and letters written using the touch screen of the STM32L496G Discovery board.

The recognition is done using a neural network trained using the [EMNIST](https://www.nist.gov/itl/iad/image-group/emnist-dataset) dataset.
